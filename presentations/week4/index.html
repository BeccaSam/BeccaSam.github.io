<h1> Competitors</h1>
<h2>Brands</h2>
<p>
  A major competitor would be "Purdys Chocolatier", they are a major competitor in the chocolate business alone but they fact
  that the company is also sustainable and fair trade makes them an even more likeable company.
</p>

<p>Another competitor may be a company called "eatingEVOLVED" they are another fair trade chocolate company that looks at chocolate
more as a superfood than a candy. </p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>
<p>
Purdys Chocolatier's strengths would be that they have shops in most major malls across Canada, they are a Canadian brand
and they give back to communities through fundraising, donation and sponsorships.
</p>

<p>The strengths of eatingEVOLVED's company would be that they are looking at chocolate from a different perspective. They are
viewing it as a pure food, not as a candy. They focus on the anti-oxidants and health benefits dark chocolate can have.</p>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<p>
Purdys Chocolatier's weakness would be their price point.
</p>

<p>The weakness that eatingEVOLVED's company would have would be that they are only selling online and not in stores.</p>

<h1>Logo Inspiration</h1>
<h2>How the logo shows what the company is about</h2>
<p>
The logo shows what the company is about as it contains characteristics of the two words in the brand name. "Parrot" as it has the wings
and tail feathers of the brand mascot, as well as a chocolate so that the viewer can tell from the logo alone (without the brand name being shown)
that this company has something to do with chocolate.
</p>

<h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand</h2>
<p>
The logo is effective for the brand as it can be appealing to many age groups, from young to old. The characteristics of a parrot
can be seen and would be appealing to children but is not too much of a caricature which would then appeal to an older audience.
The chocolate seen at the center of the logo could be the brand's best seller. This shows that the company is in fact a chocolate
company. The elements seen in the logo make the viewer aware of what the company may be about even if they didnt know the company name.

</p>

<h2>How the branding/logo makes us stand out</h2>
<p>
The branding and logo make the company stand out among the rest as it has a bright and festive colour scheme unlike companies like
Laura Secord or Purdys Chocolatier
