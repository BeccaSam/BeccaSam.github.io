    <h1>GitHub.com, GitHub for Desktop and Atom and How They Work Together</h1>

    At github.com (a site that houses repos) you need to create an account, within that account you must create a repository.
    To update your webpages you make changes in the application Atom. (a code editor)
GitHub for desktop (a downloadable application) allows you to commit those changes and then sync those changes. Doing this allows your
site to be published live, as well as the code be accessed from the github.com repository.
Important note: only sync when you need to; otherwise view your changes locally.
