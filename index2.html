    At github.com (a site that houses repos) you need to create an account, within that account you must create a repository.
    (GitHub repo is a remote copy of repo on GitHub).
    To update your webpages you make changes in the application Atom. (a code editor)
Git for desktop allows you to commit those changes and then sync those changes. Doing this allows your site to be published live.
Important note: only sync when you need to; otherwise view your changes locally.
